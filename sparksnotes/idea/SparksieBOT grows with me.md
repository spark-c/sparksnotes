## SparksieBOT grows with me!

If any project represents my continued growth as (and into) a developer, it is SparksieBOT. From the beginning when I didn't know at all what the @#$! I was doing, all the way through now and into the future -- this fella has been in continued development as I continue to add functionality and also refactor/refine the code that I had written before.

At pretty much each step in my journey and with each new skill that I learn, SparksieBOT has "levelled up" as I go back and implement those skills into its codebase.

- type annotations
- database wrangling
- error handling
- more!
