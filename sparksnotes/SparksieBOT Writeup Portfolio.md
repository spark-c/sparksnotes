# SparksieBOT
Sometime around August 2020, my little friend group from college began using Discord a lot more than we had previously -- we were moving from just "hopping in voice-chat once-a-week-or-so", to "this is our regular method of communication".

Naturally, since I was looking for new ideas for projects at the time... I wanted to make a bot that we could play around with!

Over time, SparksieBOT has turned into one of my favorite creations, for a number of reasons.

First is the interactive element of working with a bot. I *love* being able to say things and get responses; I also love the opportunities to give it a bit of a personality. (You should have seen how jealous SparksieBOT was when someone added a music bot to the server!)

I also really enjoy that SparksieBOT has grown and matured along with my ability as a developer. It began as a bare-minimum application that could respond to keywords and generate random numbers; but the more I grew, so too did SparksieBOT! By now, there are commands wihch make requests and parse HTML results; query game servers; keep track of user-defined lists... and more!

There really is a huge range of possibility for creating useful functionality, and it's so exciting to deploy new features and then see them in use right on our discord server.

I mentioned mutual growth between myself and this project -- here are a few concepts that have been very exciting to implement into the codebase over time:
- Type annotations!
	- I actually really enjoy writing type annotations, and I don't really know why. Though it tends to muddy up the simple syntax that usually makes Python pretty, typing is very satisfying and has *definitely* helped me write cleaner code and catch bugs before they cause problems.
- Error Handling
	- So far this concept is only really present in one portion of the codebase,
