## There's nothing wrong with the To-Do!

Don't get me wrong, it definitely *can* be if you want! I've seen some _great(!!)_ to-do trackers where the creators clearly had fun and were really invested in their work. To be honest, one thing I do value highly about these apps is the fact that each developer has the opportunity to focus on making it *their own*.

There's not so much to worry about in terms of super unique functionality or features -- it's a to-do app, and does exactly what you'd expect. A savvy developer will rise to the occasion and give it personality; it can have a strong theme, and can have any number of elements to help it stand out. Art, music, clever integrations of app functionality with design elements -- super neat.

When I think of these really cool to-do apps with strong themes, a couple of examples come to mind -- take a look at how these devs tackled their to-dos!

## But there are other ways, too (doo)

I'm sure many people also feel this way, but I have the most *fun* and get the most *done* when I'm working on a project that solves a problem that I have in my own day-to-day life, or is somehow very personal to me or a loved one. My favorite projects that I've worked on (and also the ones which are the most complete) fit into these categories.

Below, I'm going to introduce you to my first "CRUD" app, and hopefully provide you a little inspiration for your own ideas!

(Afterwards, I'm also going to quickly mention another project that I haven't worked on in a long time but would definitely also be an idea for this sort of thing.)

## A brief background

My first serious dive into programming happened a few years ago, when I knew that my mom had a *super* tedious computer task as part of her job that took *hoouurrrsss* of her time every single week. It wasn't difficult in the least -- just really time-consuming.

Long story short, I learned enough Python to write a script that used regex and [openpyxl](https://openpyxl.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) to scrape huge and messy text documents from her work, and turn them into nice + neat spreadsheets of sales contact leads.

It was just a command-line tool and thus not so user-friendly, so later I decided to turn it into a web app.

I had some requirements in mind for the project; briefly, a couple of those were things like:
